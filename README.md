## Coursework
Programming practice is an important part of this course. 
You need to practice to help you better understand the content of the course, and use what you learn to solve problems in the real world. 
We have carefully prepared some assignments for you, we believe these assignments will help you lay a solid foundation for machine learning and deep learning.

**Late Policy**: Everyone of you have 2 free late days for this semester. You can only use the late days for your assignments but not for the final project report. Once you have exhausted your free late days, we will deduct a late penalty of 25% per additional late day.

### Assignment 1: Machine Learning with Tabular Data (20%)
- Build your own machine learning library
- Learn more about optimization and generalization
- Play with real-world tabular dataset
